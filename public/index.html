				"The Love-Inns are not a girl band; they are an elaborate collective of individuals who want to make good punk music, all while challenging the boys club mentality that comes with the genre. The Love-Inns are Ariela Barer (she/her) on bass, vocals and sometimes drums, Eden Hain (they/them) on guitar and vocals, and Mack Kenny (he/him) on drums. And they make some damn good music."
